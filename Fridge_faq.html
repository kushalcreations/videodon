    <p id="s1"><br>1) Can I change the direction the fridge door opens?<br><br>
        Many refrigerators offer the option to hinge the door on either the right or left side. Before you make a
        purchase make sure to check if the door has to be special ordered for right or left hinge or if the unit is
        field reversible.

        <br><br><br>2) How cold should my refrigerator be?<br><br>
        A good rule of thumb to keep your food fresh is to set the internal refrigerator temperature between 35-40°
        Fahrenheit. If the internal temperature gets much higher than 40° Fahrenheit you risk decreasing the shelf life
        of your food and possible food spoilage.

        <br><br><br>3) Does my refrigerator need annual maintenance?<br><br>
        Yes, consult your product manual for maintenance tips from the manufacturer. We have a list of general
        maintenance recommendations to keep your refrigerator running efficiently.

        <br><br><br><img id="i2" src="./img/Fridge french.jpg"><br>

        4) Can I purchase an extended warranty after I purchased my refrigerator?<br><br>
        Yes. We highly recommend purchasing an extended warranty that will prolong the manufacturer's warranty up to 5
        years. This could save you the cost of repairs over the long term.

        <br><br><br>5) What is the difference between a beverage refrigerator and regular refrigerator?<br><br>
        Typically a beverage refrigerator is designed with presentation in mind; sleek stainless steel trim, a glass
        door that allows you to display your drinks, and shelves designed for can and bottle storage. Most beverage
        refrigerators are designed to hold temperatures between 40-44° Fahrenheit; while a traditional refrigerator is
        designed to hold colder temperatures to keep food fresh. A regular refrigerator should be set between
        35-40°Fahrenheit.
