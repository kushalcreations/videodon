    <p id="s1"><br>1) Which is better in the front-loading and top-loading washing machines?<br><br>
        The front-loading and top-loading machines are designed to serve
        different laundry needs with the same efficiency. Adding to it, the space is also a
        thing to consider while opting for one of them. If your laundry area is compact and
        has smaller roof space, go for a front load washer.


        <br><br><br>2) Are more wash modes and features in the washing
        machines worth buying?<br><br>
        Technically, yes. Increased wash modes assure seamless washing. However, stay
        alarmed from being scammed by the brand as they may sell you something that you
        didn't even require. Therefore, understand the benefits of every feature and only
        then go for one.

        <br><br><br>3) Why is the washing machine tub not spinning?<br><br>
        It can happen due to numerous reasons. First, you have to notice any anomaly or abnormal behaviour in the
        machine apart from not spinning. If not, the following can be the reasons
        1. Burnt Motor
        2. Dirt was collected on the motor plates
        3. Broken belt
        4. Wire connections are loose

        <br><br><br><img id="i2" src="wash.jpg"><br>

        4) Why is the machine not draining out the water?<br><br>
        The drainage system of a washing machine is located in the lower corner. Certain reasons are:
        1. Blocked drain hose due to dirt.
        2. Non-functional drain pump.
        3. The drain pump cord connected to the console is broken.
        4. Coin/Lint filter is choked or full.

        <br><br><br>5) Are Laundry sheets better than regular detergents?<br><br>
        Yes. The washing machine sheets are a better alternative to conventional detergents. They provide a residue-free
        wash with numerous benefits.
