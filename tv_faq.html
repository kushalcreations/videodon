    <p id="s1"><br>1) What are the factors to consider before buying a TV?<br><br>
        Before buying any appliance it is important to consider some factors that can affect its usage and life. If you
        are planning to buy a new TV for yourself, some of the important factors to consider are TV size, usage, screen
        type, price, brand, warranty, smart features, etc. Keep in mind what you need and sort the features out within
        your budget before making a purchase.

        <br><br><br>2) Why are ads so much louder than the show?<br><br>
        Most of the advertisements or ads that you see on TV are louder than the show to get the attention of the
        viewers. It is done by following a technique known as multiband compression. It helps in splitting the audio
        into different tones/slides and then each of these tones is set at the maximum limit that is digitally allowed.
        Thus, it makes the audio during the ads louder than the audio of the shows.

        <br><br><br>3) What is the average lifespan of a new TV?<br><br>
        The average lifespan of a TV is approximately 4 to 10 years i.e., 40,000 to 1,00,000 hours. This varies based on
        the maintenance and usage of the TV. You can keep your TV in good condition and increase its lifespan by taking
        care of it properly.

        <br><br><br><img id="i2" src="./img/Curved Tv.jpg"><br>
        4) Is it worth investing in curved and OLED TVs?<br><br>
        Whether the curved and OLED TVs are worth investing your money in or not depends on the usage of your TV. If you
        only watch movies and other such shows on your TV, it is better to just get a bigger 4K TV. However, if you
        prefer sports events, gaming, and HD 4K movies, getting a curved or OLED TV for yourself will be a good idea.
        Just make sure to follow your budget and the TV buying guide to get the best TV for your home.

        <br><br><br>5) Which is Better - USB or Add-on Media Player?<br><br>
        Multimedia playback from a USB port is the norm these days but there may be a catch. As compared to a media
        player, the TV interface for USB playback might be slow — check the performance before you buy.
