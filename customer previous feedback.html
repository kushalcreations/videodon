<br><p>What sets VideoDON TVs apart from the rest of the pack is webOS.
     The platform is easy to use and works extremely well with modern electronics. 
     Moreover, with so many installable apps, we officially cut the cord this year and have only gigabit Internet.</p>

     <br><p>This is my 4th LG TV. Still have 2 and gave one away.
         Impressed with the picture and how easy the set is to operate.
         Sometimes a little lag in the picture but it was expected by what the sales person advised before
          I made my decision.</p>

<br><p>I decided to ‘go for it’ and purchased the OLED model. Very nice indeed. This tv fit right in to my home theatre system. I had cut the cord and worked my way through the array of streaming services. The VideoDON takes the picture to entire new level I didn’t think I’d ever experience.</p>

<br><p>I’ve got 5 in my house. The oldest is 7 years old. They all work perfect. Well worth the money. I’ll never buy a different brand. Also rated very high thru many online outfits. The color, the the brightness and everything thing about them is great. My smallest is a 20 inch in my smallest bedroom. They go up in size from there. My 65 inch is the largest in my living room so I have a variety of sizes and she’s never once have I had to have them fixed. My newest one is 4 years old now almost 5. Thanks for letting me share my experience with anyone that reads this. Very satisfied customer.</p>

<br><p>I bought a 60" VideoDON TV, it is just 6 months old. It has developed issues with the picture, VideoDON said they would send a technician to fix it, they never showed, after speaking to the repair service VideoDON have said my TV is unrepairable due to a parts shortage and issued me a credit for the TV to the store where I bought it. I had to pay the taxes all over again about $150, I contacted VideoDON and they said they do refund this as they can not control what the stores do. Paying the taxes has nothing to with the store here in Canada, I asked why I could not have done a straight swap. So I am out $150 due to the TV having issues, no fault of mine, really poor customer relations</p>

<br><p>There are some things that my VideoDon TV lacks on, but it's better than the ones I've had before. The main issue I have with my TV is the bootup speed, another thing too is how it processes things as it takes a while for the TV to handle things. The internet connectivity on it too is pretty slow, even when connected directly to the router using Ethernet. The smart features on the TV is also pretty limited as I wished to have the Amazon Alexa integration capability in it too, but I didn't get that in with the TV -- so I was quite a bit disappointed with it. My entire house is equipped with Amazon Echo devices and it's also a nice touch where I'm able to control a lot of smart appliances and devices with it which makes everything for me much easier to manage since I tend to be pretty busy throughout the day, so it takes a while to get things going.</p>
