        <p id="s1"><br>1) What sizes do built in ovens come in?<br><br>
        Our range of built in ovens come in the different sizes of 60 cm, 70 cm 
        and 77 cms. Such a wider size range allows for a larger capacity of 70L 
        and more, which helps you to comfortably cook multiple dishes at one time as well as cater to the needs of a large Indian household.

            
        <br><br><br>2) Is an oven better than a microwave?<br><br>
        It totally depends on what your particular cooking needs and requirements are in the kitchen. If you're looking for some basic reheating and cooking a regular microwave may suit you better. But if you're into full-fledged cooking and baking a diverse range of savouries you should definitely opt for our wide range of built-in ovens or even 
        combi microwave ovens.


        <br><br><br>3) Does the oven consume a lot of electricity?<br><br>
        This depends on how regularly you use your oven and the energy efficiency of the model. This is why it's very important to purchase a top notch oven that has a high energy rating. It significantly reduces the energy consumption, thus helping you avoid those sky high electricity bills!

        4) Does a wall oven have to be in a cabinet?<br><br>
        Installing your wall oven in a cabinet ensures that there is enough room for the oven cavity and its electrical components. A cabinet customised according to the oven size dimensions will give maximum benefits in terms of support. 

        <br><br><br>5) Can I use an oven for traditional Indian cooking?<br><br>
        Yes! It's totally possible to use your oven to cook traditional Indian food. While we've been using the stovetop
        for ages, using an oven to cook delicious Indian meals is not only faster but may also prove to be quite a 
        treat for your tastebuds!
