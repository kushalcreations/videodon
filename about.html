    <h3><b>Intrepid Entrepreneurship</b></h3>
    <p>
        An enterprise with odds stacked against it makes a great business sense.
        This is because higher the obstacles lower the number of players likely to be active in that field; thus paving
        the way for extraordinary returns.
        What is required is a bold approach, a confidence and a willingness to brave the odds. VideoDON’s foray into oil
        and gas is one such brave endeavor that arises from immense faith in the competence of the company’s in-house
        managerial talent.
        These internships offer hands-on technical education and experience and valuable networking opportunities. With
        a limited number of internships available, early application is encouraged. Many such opportunities exist within
        our engineering, business, and general management groups.

        technology and replacing outdated technology with the best-in-class offers of the times.

    <h3><b>Inspired Thinking</b></h3>
    <p>The future is unpredictable, but if we don’t do anything about it, the road ahead will be fraught with grave
        risk.
        And so, VideoDON extrapolates future trends on the basis of current changes in technology and preferences, as
        well as sheer gut feel.
        Business instincts are worth their weight in gold. Driven by these instincts, the company has made some bold
        forays into fields of oil and gas, which has proved to be absolute money-spinners.
        Inspired Thinking is an innovative way of discovering new ideas to achieve meaningful success. When someone or
        something inspires you, it pushes and propels you to do something new or different.
        It gives you new ideas and a strong feeling of enthusiasm and excitement.</p>
